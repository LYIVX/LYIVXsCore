Each example shows how the different crafting stations work together to create useful items.\n\nThe [[entry:crafting_table:crafting table]] is used for basic item creation, while specialized stations like the [[entry:furnace:furnace]] and [[entry:brewing_stand:brewing stand]] handle specific types of processing. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right tool for each crafting task."

These ingots are then used by the [[entry:smithing_table:smithing table]] to create enhanced equipment. This progression system provides clear goals and rewards for mastering each crafting system.\n\nExplore the [[category:crafting_systems:Crafting Systems]] category to learn more about each individual station and how they can be optimized for your specific needs."
